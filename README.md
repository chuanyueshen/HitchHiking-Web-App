## Project Summary
_Please find more details in the report._

HitchHiking enables you to explore hiking trails, find buddies for outdoor activities, and recharge your energy at a nearby restaurant. We give users the freedom to search for beautiful trails and travel buddies based on their preferences. HitchHiking's database consists of five main tables that will collect trails' features including locations and ratings, which will be used to map different trails and promote new hiking trails, travel buddies, and interesting nearby activities to our users.

## Project Detailed Description
HitchHiking is a database-driven web project that aims to help users explore all trails in the U.S. Are you tired of staying in your room all day during COVID? Have you ever wanted to find buddies to explore hiking trails and camp outdoor together? Do you miss the beauty of nature and fresh air in forests? If so, HitchHiking is here to help you! With HitchHiking, you can explore hiking trails, find buddies for outdoor activities, and recharge your energy at a nearby restaurant.

HitchHiking's user interface allows users to search for trails based on trail information. Once you have signed up for an account, you can set user preference and search for specific trails based on locations, features, rating, etc. What's more, you can even find buddies to travel with you on HitchHiking. If there are other users who are interested in going to the same trail, you can connect with them and start your own adventure group! After your exciting adventure, you can also search for a nearby restaurant for a nice meal and chat with your new friends.

HitchHiking's database consists of five main tables that will connect users and trails together. We have credible datasets that can accurately define and locate trails in the U.S. Our users can also input their user preferences, travel history, and rating of trails into the database, which will be used to promote travel buddies and new trails that they may be interested. Don't like our promotion, no problem! We have listed features for different types of trails, match your preference with trail types to better discover your favorite trails. Our purpose is to make it easier for you to find new trails that you may be interested in, as well as new friends that you will travel with.
