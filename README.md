## Project Summary
_Please find more details in the report._

HitchHiking enables you to explore different hiking trails, find travel buddies, and enjoy nearby restaurants. We provide our users the opportunity to search for hiking trails based on their interests, and learn about the features, rating, and location of various trails. Our users can add the trails they have visited or are interested in to design their own travel schedule, which will be used to match travel buddies and suggest nearby restaurants based on their schedule and interests. You can also add your favorite features to your preference to match with other users who share the same interests. In addition, our recommendation page will provide you with the high-rating trails that include your favorite features so that you can find future trails more easily. We also have a ranking system that will show the top hikers of the year based on usersâ€™ trail history.
